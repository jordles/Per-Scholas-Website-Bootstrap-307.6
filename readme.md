## Lessons Learned / Process

I don't think I'm used to bootstrap yet, I had a lot of trouble coding this because of all the time i spent searching up the documentation. I think i could have done this assignment faster if i just coded it out manually. One particular problem i had was adding margins/gaps to the grid system directly, and the only way i could fix it was by wrapping these grid items in other bootstrap elements that have internal padding/margins in them. I don't completely understand what's happening in the background honestly. 

Another issue was figuring out which classes was necessary to implement the collapse and offcanvas functionality. It also matters how some of these classes were structured. Some of these classes needed to be in a standalone div to work for some reason. I knew the ids and the target attributes were triggering these functionalities, its just the order that some of the elements that needed to be wrapped in were quite tedious. 

The only benefit i see is the responsiveness of bootstrap. I'm quite happy i didn't need to write a single media query or write the appropriate responsive units.
